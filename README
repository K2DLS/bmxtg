bmxtg.py v1.2 (04/20/2017)

The following files must be stored in the same directory:

	bmxtg.py
	talkgroups.conf
	masters.conf
	buttons.conf

To configure bmxtg.py for use, open the masters.conf file in an editor.  Look
for the [My Master] section at the top of the file.  The bm_master option
should be set to the number of the master that your dv4mini client software
connects to.  As of version 1.2, masters.conf no longer contains the list of
all Brandmeister master servers.  This is downloaded dynamically when bmxtg.py
is started.

There are 12 memory buttons.  Place the names of the memories you want to use
in the buttons.conf file.  The name that you use in the buttons.conf file
must EXACTLY match the name for that talkgroup as listed in the Brandmeister
groups file at https://api.brandmeister.network/v1.0/groups/.  As of version
1.2, talkgroups.conf contains only those talkgroups that you wish to override.

The talkgroup list contains some long names.  Long names used on a button will
cuase the keypad to become wider.  You can shorten or abbreviate the names
if you wish to have a narrower memory keypad.  For example, "New Jersey" can
become "NJ".  The longest talkgroup name in use will determine the buton width.
However, if you change the text in button.conf you must add or change the
corresponding text in talkgroups.conf or that button will not function.  You
only need entries in talkgroups.conf for those labels that you are overriding.

Make certain that bmxtg.py is executable (chmod +x bmxtg.py) or you will
have to execute it by first running python (python ./bmxtg.py).
